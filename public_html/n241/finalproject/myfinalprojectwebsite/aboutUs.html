 Modification History: 
	April 30th 2022 - Designed the entire page
 Checked the website in MSEdge, Opera, Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Tor.
 Opera seemed to display a little smaller.
 Chrome displayed the page a little larger.
 Tor did not adjust in size to fit the page.  I had to adjust the page manual.

				<h2>About Us</h2>
	
				<br>
	
				<h3>Roberto Kuhn</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					Roberto has over 25 years in the show rings and training areas.  He has won nine
					Championship titles and ten Obedience title.  The highest award in obedience was
					a Optch with standard poodle. (Notch is scent work.) Roberto offers classes and
					private lessons. His number one goal is to help you and your new four legged best
					friend bond for a life time of joy. If interested in his classes sign up fast,
					his lessons fill up quickly.
				</p>
	
				<br>
	
				<h3>Mary Henderson</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					Mary has over 10 years of experience in the obedience rings.  She is amazing with
					terriers and dogs with a strong personality. She has Jack Russells and is well
					known in the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America (JRTCA). Mary only does group
					classes. She has found that with strong personality puppies they need the group
					socialization more than private one-on-one attention.

				<h2>AMAZING CLASS</h2>
					<p>
						I took an basic class with my JRT and Mary was great.  She helped me understand
						why he acts crazy sometimes and how to redirect his attention.  Until I
						took this class I had debated giving Jack away. I am so glad I didn't do
						that and took classes here.
					</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Took All Three Classes</h2>
					<p>
						My lab Scarlet and I started out in the potty training class, moved to 
						the puppy class, and ended with the basic obedience class. Scarlet loved
						going to class and especially enjoyed the socialization aspect of the
						classes.  We had both Roberto and Mary at different times.  Even though
						they have different personalities they are both amazing.
					</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Tried the Classes, One-On-One Better for Us</h2>
					<p>
						I tired the basic class first.  My pitt and I had a lot of trouble
						following the pace. Palmer's Pet Service was great. Even though we were
						over halfway through the class they gave us a credit for the entire 
						class. We used the credit toward private sessions with Roberto.  He was
						great with Roy and myself. I learned many of the issues we due to 
						things I was doing wrong. Now Roy and I have a happy home together.
