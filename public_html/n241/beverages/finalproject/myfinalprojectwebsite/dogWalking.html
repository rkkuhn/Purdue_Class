 Checked the website in MSEdge, Opera, Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Tor.
 Opera seemed to display a little smaller.
 Chrome displayed the page a little larger.
 Tor did not adjust in size to fit the page.  I had to adjust the page manual.

					<em>Aug 29, 2022</em> - Got to Rocky's home around 1:00 pm It was

					treats.  At 6:00 pm Rocky and I went for an hour long walk.  Got back
					and allowed him to cool down.  Around 7:00 pm Rocky and I had dinner. Let 
					him outside before I left at 7:30 pm. AC

					<em>Aug 29, 2022</em> - Shaggy is an sweet Old English Sheep dog. Due 
					to the nature of his thick coat we always go  for a morning walk when
					it is cooler. Shaggy enjoys the Monon Trail and has a few friends on
					the trail that we stop and chat with.  Depending on the day he will
					walks during the cooler times. He loves to play fetch so we trying to
					get in a good game of fetch. Today we had good weather so Shaggy was
					able to get in a good 45 minutes of fetch without messing up his
					coat.  Arrived at 8:00 am and left 9:15 am. BK

					<em>Aug 30, 2022</em> - Today was Aggie's afternoon visit. Aggie is
					15 years old and misses her owner when they go to work. Aggie likes 
					sitting on the couch getting loved on and tummy rubs. We spent an
					hour just enjoying each others company.  Let her outside for a quick
					restroom break before I left. LL
