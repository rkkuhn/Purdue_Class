		<h2>Here is some interesting information about the history of the breed</h2>
		<br>
			<blockquote>
				The Jack Russell Terrier was developed in England some 200 years ago
				to hut foxes. This dog is a  lively, independent, and clever little creature.
				They're charming and affectionate, <em>BUT</em> they are a handful to train and manage.
				This breed is for experienced dog parents only!
