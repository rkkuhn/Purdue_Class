 Checked the website in MSEdge, Opera, Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Tor.
 Opera seemed to display a little smaller.
 Chrome displayed the page a little larger.
 Tor did not adjust in size to fit the page.  I had to adjust the page manual.

			<h2>Potty Training Class</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				Learning how to potty train puppies at the right time and place is one of the most 
				important first steps you can take for a long, happy life together. House soiling 
				is among the top reasons why dogs lose their homes or end up in shelters. Few 
				people are willing to put up with a dog who destroys rugs and flooring, or who 
				leaves a stinky mess that you have to clean after a hard day at work.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				That’s why it’s so important to make sure that you do some research in advance on 
				how to house train a dog, decide what will work best for your situation, and make 
				a plan.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				There are tried-and-true methods for training your puppy, says Mary Burch, Ph.D., 
				director of the AKC’s Canine Good Citizen and S.T.A.R. Puppy programs. These 
				include:
			</p>
			<br>
			<blockquote>
				<ol>
					<li>Crate training.</li>
					<li>Paper training.</li>
					<li>Indoor potty training.<li>
				</ol>
			</blockquote>

			<h2>Puppy Training Class</h2>
			<br>
				<p>
					A good training class will do more than just teach you how to train your dog. 
					These days, there is a lot more information available about dog behavior, 
					socialization, and dog body language, and an effective trainer will discuss these 
					topics in class along with the training topics at hand.
				</p>
			<br>
				<p>
					Subjects like the importance of socialization of puppies up to 16 weeks old, and 
					reading your dog’s body language, are important topics that are now always 
					discussed in training classes but we touch on this subject.
				</p>
			<br>
				<p>
					Another often overlooked discussion point involves handling and grooming. If your 
					instructor offers good advice and you follow her recommendations, your veterinarian 
					and groomer will thank you.
				</p>
			<br>
				<p>
					Practice handling and grooming your pup from the time he is very young, and your vet 
					and groomer will have no trouble examining, treating, bathing, or clipping him. However, 
					if the only time your dog sees nail clippers or a brush is at the vet’s or groomer’s, 
					he will likely come to associate it with scary or unpleasant things.
				</p>
			<br>
				<p>
					If you start at home, where your dog is comfortable, you can make the vet and grooming 
					experiences a lot more pleasant for everyone. And as a bonus, many groomers charge 
					less for easy-to-handle dogs, because they can be groomed without the assistance of a 
					second groomer.
