 Create Date: April 28th, 2022
 Purpose: Final Project for HTML class
 Modification History: 
	April 28th 2022 - Added Header and Footer
 Checked the website in MSEdge, Opera, Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Tor.
 Opera seemed to display a little smaller.
 Chrome displayed the page a little larger.
 Tor did not adjust in size to fit the page.  I had to adjust the page manual.
