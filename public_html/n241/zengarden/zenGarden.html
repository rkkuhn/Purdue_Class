 Purpose: Practice CSS skills and organizational patterns for web pages.
 Modification History: 
 17 Jan 2016: This is a slightly modified version of zenGarden.html by Michele Roberts (LJC)
 Checked the website in MSEdge, Opera, Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Tor.
 Opera seemed to display a little smaller.
 Chrome displayed the page a little larger.
 Tor did not adjust in size to fit the page.  I had to adjust the page manual.

    	<p>A desciption taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fainting_goat">Wikipedia...</a></p>
    	<p>A myotonic goat, otherwise known as the fainting goat, is a domestic goat whose muscles freeze for roughly 10 seconds when the goat feels panic. Though painless, this generally results in the animal collapsing on its side. The characteristic is caused by a hereditary genetic disorder called myotonia congenita. When startled, younger goats will stiffen and fall over. Older goats learn to spread their legs or lean against something when startled, and often they continue to run about in an awkward, stiff-legged shuffle.</p>
		<p>Some fun YouTube videos of fainting goats:</p>

        <tr>
        	<td>HTML 2.0 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force HTML Working Group in 1996.</td>
            <td>HTML 3.2 became a W3C Recommendation 14. January 1997. HTML 3.2 added new features such as fonts, tables, applets, superscripts, subscripts and more, to the existing HTML 2.0 standard.</td>
            <td>HTML 4.0 became a W3C Recommendation 18. December 1997. A second release was issued on 24. April 1998 with only some editorial corrections.</td>
            <td>HTML 4.01 became a W3C Recommendation 24. December 1999. It was a minor update of corrections and bug-fixes from HTML 4.0.</td>
            <td>XHTML 1.0 reformulates HTML 4.01 in XML. It became a W3C Recommendation 20. January 2000.</td>
            <td><p>HTML 5 improves interoperability, and reduces development costs, by making precise rules on how to handle all HTML elements, and how to recover from errors.</p>
            <p>Some of the new features in HTML 5 are functions for embedding audio, video, graphics, client-side data storage, and interactive documents.</p>
            <p>On January 22nd, 2008, W3C published a working draft for HTML 5.</p></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>In other words, HTML5 is newest in the world of HTML. It's best to start using it now than have to learn it later.</p>
