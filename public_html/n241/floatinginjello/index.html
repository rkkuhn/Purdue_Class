					<h1>What is it Really Like Living With a Jack Russell?</h1>
					<br>
					<p>
						You have seen TV shows, movies, and commercials with a cute, 
						well-behaved small dog doing everything on cue while being sweet and 
						loving. It is all a lie. They do not tell you that all the hours of 
						training have gone in to make this brilliant, stubborn breed listen. 
						Usually, more than one Jack Russell is doing the same job, and you 
						don't even know the difference. Are they fun-loving? Yes! Are they 
						loyal? Oh yes! Are they stubborn? Oh, big time, like a mule!!!
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>

						My seventeen lb Jack Russell is name Palmer. He has been my loyal 
						companion for 11 years now. I adopted him from the <em>Texas Jack Russell</em> 
						Rescue when he was 5 years old. From the time he came into the house, 
						he was a hot little mess. But it hasn't been until recently that he 
						has made it very clear who runs this house. Let me be obvious here, 
						and <em>IT IS NOT ME!</em>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Ever since the pandemic, having me home 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
					 	he figured that would be the new norm. Since going back to school 
					 	full time, he is a pain in the butt once I get home to study. He will 
					 	cry, bark, and paw at my leg to get me out of the home office and play 
					 	with him. I have to stay at school to get my homework and studying 
					 	completed. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						For the most part, Palmer is easy to maintain. Maintenance is a 
						weekly brushing, once a month bath, and lots and lots of play or 
						walks. Palmer is a high-energy dog that does great with kids 7 
						years and older. Never trust a Jack Russell with children younger 
						than 7. They have eye issues such as cataracts and blindness in 
						the late stages of life. Palmer scratched one eye and almost lost 
						the entire eye. Palmer's eye was saved, but he is 95% blind in 
						that eye, and his other eye has cataracts. Medicated eye drops 
						have to be given to him twice a day. Other than that, his health 
						is excellent. The one thing one will notice with Jack Russell's is 
						they will start to slow down when it starts to get close to the 
						end of their life span. Jack Russell can live 15+ years old, so be 
						prepared for a long-life companion.
					</p>
					<br> 
					<p>
						The real question is, would I ever get another Jack Russell again. To 
						be honest, yes! So far, I have had three Jack Russells and will get 
						another one once Palmer is no longer playing my little terrorist. With 
						that said, Jack Russell's are not for everyone.
					</p>

						Check out the following site through <em>American Kennel Club (AKC)</em> for 
						more information about care, personality, and training. It is essential 
						to do your research before getting a Jack Russell or any breed.

						<h2>Things I've Done to my Owner!</h2>
						<br>
						<br>
						<ol>
							<li>1. Learned how to open trash cans!</li>
							<li>2. Broke a $200 trash can!</li>
							<li>3. Learned how to open cabinet drawers!</li>
							<li>4. Take everything out of drawers for my owner to pick up!</li>
							<li>5. I laid everything nice and neat infront of the drawer!</li>
						</ol>
					
					<br>
				
					<p>
						The above list is just the tip of the iceberg of the things Palmer 
						has taught himself to get into trouble. You can see him thinking, 
						"Is the punishment worth the crime?" 95% of the time, the crime out 
						weights the punishment.
