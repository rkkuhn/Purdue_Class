			<h2>Background Information</h2>

				<p>
					I spent some time in Ethiopia before starting Kindergarten with my 
					parents. I Graduated High School in 1987 where I moved to San Antonio, TX 
					to attend Trinity University.  I wanted to major in Computer Science but
				 	my family made it clear there was no money to be made in that field and 
				 	forced me to get a degree in Business Administration.  They made it 
				 	clear, <q>We are paying for your education you will get a degree in the 
				 	field we tell you.</q> So, after Trinity University I stayed in San Antonio 
				 	for 10 years cutting my teeth at my first job. In 2000, I moved to 
				 	Austin, TX with the .com boom. Stayed in Austin, TX where I met my future 
				 	partner. Stayed in Austin for 10 years and moved from being a Trainer, 
				 	Training Manager, Director of Training, and VP of Training and 
				 	Development. After 10 years in Austin, I moved to Houston, TX with my 
				 	partner. We spent 10 years in Houston, TX where the second half of going 
				 	back to school.
