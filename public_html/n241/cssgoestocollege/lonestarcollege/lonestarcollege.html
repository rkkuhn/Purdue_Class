			<h2>Brief History While Attending LoneStar College</h2>
			<br>
				<p>
					I started Spring of 2017 with two classes.  Only taking two classes was 
					my way to see if going back to school at my age would be good for me.  
					I wasnâ€™t sure if I could take the stress of handling lectures, homework, 
					and tests.  On the first day of classes, I was terrified of the unknown.  
					I have trained and competed on horseback, trained dogs, and faced a room 
					of 500 people yet the first day of school was the first time my nerves 
					were all over the place. Then I slowly added another class and another 
					until I was taking a full-time load.  I met some incredible people and 
					made some lasting friendships.  The great thing about going to a community 
					college was there are a lot of people my age. It made the transition back 
					into academia a little easier. Time flew by and before I knew it and it 
					was time for me to a university to finish this journey.  My partner was 
					from Speedway, IN. They found a job up here, so I applied to Ball State, 
					IUPUI, Butler, Purdue, and IU Bloomington.  To my surprise and horror, 
					I was accepted to all of them.  The next part of this journey begins.
