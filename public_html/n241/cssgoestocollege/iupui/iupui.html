				<p>
					After researching all the Computer Science programs, I decided on IUPUI.  
					There are two reasons why I decided on this University: 	 
				</p>
			<br>
				<ul>
					<li>The US has ranked this program in the top ten in the country.</li>
					<li>It is a commuter school making it easier for me to attend.</li>
				
				</ul>
			<br>
			<br>	
				<p>
					Started my junior year in fall 2020 during the pandemic, being that I was 
					used to face-to-face I spent the fall and spring with two classes.  
					Again, I wanted to make sure I would be able to handle an online 
					environment. In the fall of 2021, I changed over to a full-time student.  
					I am looking forward to continuing my education and graduating with a 
					cyber-security focus. Although, I have to say that taking this class has 
					peaked my excitement toward HTML. I am thinking of taking more HTML 
					classes.
